# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
A major bank is experiencing customer attrition in its credit card division.  
This project aims to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to close their credit card accounts, enabling proactive retention strategies.

Using a synthetic dataset containing customer information, transaction history, and demographic details, we will:
- Perform data exploration and preprocessing.
- Engineer features to capture key customer behaviors.
- Train multiple classification models to predict churn.
- Evaluate models using relevant business and statistical metrics.
- Provide insights and actionable recommendations for retention.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Explore dataset and summarize key statistics.  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, high cardinality, and imbalance.
   
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create meaningful features to improve model performance.  
   - Apply dimensionality reduction if necessary.

3. **Model Development & Evaluation**  
   - Train and compare at least two classification models.  
   - Handle class imbalance via SMOTE or class weights.  
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identify key drivers of attrition.  
   - Provide actionable strategies for the bank.

5. **(Optional Bonus)**  
   - Build a Streamlit dashboard to visualize attrition risk.  
   - Deploy model demo.

# Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
A major bank is experiencing customer attrition in its credit card division.  
This project aimed to build a predictive model to identify customers likely to close their credit card accounts, enabling proactive retention strategies.

We explored a synthetic dataset containing customer information, transaction history, and demographic details. The project involved:
- Data exploration and preprocessing.  
- Feature engineering to capture customer behaviors.  
- Training and evaluating classification models.  
- Providing insights and recommendations for churn reduction.

## Objectives
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**  
   - Explored dataset and summarized key statistics.  
   - Handled missing values, outliers, duplicates, and imbalance.  
   
2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Created features to improve model performance.  
   - Considered dimensionality reduction.  

3. **Model Development & Evaluation**  
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   - Addressed class imbalance with resampling techniques.  
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.  

4. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identified dataset limitations and possible improvements.  
   - Suggested business strategies for retention.  

5. **Dashboard**  
   - Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard to show the **EDA process and model performance**.

## Notebooks
- `notebooks/dev/` â†’ Development notebooks (no outputs, used for experimentation).  
- `notebooks/reports/` â†’ Final notebooks with outputs (recommended for review).

## Results Summary
- **Models Tested**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  - Accuracy appeared high.  
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score for churn were very low.  
  - ROC-AUC ~0.5, suggesting near-random performance.  
- **Finding**: The dataset lacked predictive power â€” models were unable to reliably predict churn.  
- **Takeaway**: Richer behavioral and transactional features are needed for meaningful churn prediction.
